# Blogger Platform - Sprint 4, Week 2

## Overview

This sprint focuses on continuing the migration of the application to NestJS. The primary goals are to complete the authentication block and implement CRUD operations for users with basic authentication.

## Tasks:

1. **Continue Migration to NestJS:**
   - Further transition the application to the NestJS framework.

2. **Implement Authentication Block:**
   - Implement password recovery.
   - Implement user registration.
   - Implement user login (excluding refreshToken flow).

3. **Implement CRUD Operations for Users:**
   - Ensure CRUD operations for users are functional with basic authentication.

### Implementation Details:

**1. Continuing Migration to NestJS:**
   - Continue setting up and migrating the existing project framework to NestJS.
   - Ensure compatibility and functionality during the migration process.

**2. Implementing Authentication Block:**
   - **Password Recovery:**
     - Implement the functionality to recover a user's password.
   - **User Registration:**
     - Implement user registration functionality.
   - **User Login:**
     - Implement user login functionality, excluding the refreshToken flow.

**3. Implementing CRUD Operations for Users with Basic Authentication:**
   - **Create User:**
     - Implement the functionality to create a new user.
   - **Read User:**
     - Implement the functionality to retrieve user details.
   - **Update User:**
     - Implement the functionality to update user information.
   - **Delete User:**
     - Implement the functionality to delete a user.
   - Ensure these operations require basic authentication.

### Testing:

- Implement new tests to validate the authentication block.
- Develop and run tests to ensure the correct functionality of CRUD operations for users with basic authentication.

### Test Cases:

1. **Password Recovery:**
   - Test the password recovery process.
   - Ensure users can recover their passwords successfully.

2. **User Registration:**
   - Test the user registration process.
   - Ensure new users can register successfully.

3. **User Login:**
   - Test the user login process.
   - Ensure users can log in successfully without the refreshToken flow.

4. **CRUD Users with Basic Authentication:**
   - **Create User:**
     - Test creating a new user with basic authentication.
   - **Read User:**
     - Test retrieving user details with basic authentication.
   - **Update User:**
     - Test updating user information with basic authentication.
   - **Delete User:**
     - Test deleting a user with basic authentication.

### Notes:

- The focus is on ensuring functionality with basic authentication.
- New tests will be crucial in verifying that the migration to NestJS and implementation of the authentication block do not affect the core functionalities.
- Refer to the NestJS documentation and best practices for efficient implementation and testing.
